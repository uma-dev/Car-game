# Car-game

## Overview

Little classic car game using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) modules on **Python**. 
This is a first look into 2D simple games. 
The code was written with a FP _programming paradigm_ in order to ilustrate it's characteristics but it could be written using the _OOP paradigm_. Keep in mind that it would require more code, but it'll be scalable and maybe more legible.  
Hope you enjoy
