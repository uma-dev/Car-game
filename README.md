# Car-game

##Overview
Little game using pygame on Python. 
This is a first look into 2D simple games. 
The code was written with a FP programming paradigm in order to ilustrate it's characteristics but it could be written using the OOP paradigm. Keep in mind that it would require more code, but it'll be more legible and scalable.  
Hope you enjoy
